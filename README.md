Local Setup

First, download the Google App Engine SDK and open the launcher application to create the symlinks you'll need to run dev_appserver.py in the terminal.

Once that's all set, clone this repository:

$ git clone git@github.com:xdplethi/Udacity-MultiUser.git
And simply run dev_appserver.py . from the main project folder. 
Go to http://localhost:8080 to see the blog app running!
